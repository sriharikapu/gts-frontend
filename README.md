This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Global Trade System is, well, a global system for trading anything you can tokenize, ranging from virtual assets in video games and streetwear clothes to real money, in a safe way without any risk of being scammed or getting counterfeit products. The fundamental value in our project is decentralizing trust - we assume that if people want to have something, they already trust the company who made it, that is why our trust model is based exactly on that relation. On our platform, everyone can become a "trusted" third party (although we prefer manufacturers, or REALLY widely known and trusted people from the community), who (for example: for a small fee) emit tokens for the goods they store. It's essentially a middlemen system widely known to gaming community, but for every other industry, combined.

Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
Our platform is powered by a smart contract deployed on Ethereum and written obviously in Solidity using Truffle. End user can interact with it via our web interface, written in Javascript using React.
